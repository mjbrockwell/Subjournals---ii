# Bug Report: Subjournals Detection Issue

## Issue Description
The extension was not properly detecting configured subjournals, showing an error message "No subjournals configured" even when subjournals were properly set up.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Create a page titled `[[roam/subjournals]]`
2. Add a block titled `My Subjournals:`
3. Add subjournals as children of this block
4. Navigate to a daily note page
5. Click the "Add to Subjournal?" button
6. Expected: See dropdown with configured subjournals
7. Actual: See error message "No subjournals configured"

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by multiple factors in the `getSubjournals()` function:

1. **Incorrect Block Matching**
   - The code was using a regex pattern `/my\s+subjournals\s*:/i` to find the "My Subjournals:" block
   - This pattern was matching the instruction text that contained the words "My Subjournals:" within it
   - The instruction block was being incorrectly identified as the configuration block

2. **Inefficient Data Access**
   - The code was making multiple separate queries to get block data
   - The page structure data was already available but not being utilized properly
   - Child blocks were being queried separately instead of using the existing structure

3. **Block Hierarchy Issues**
   - The code wasn't properly traversing the block hierarchy
   - Child blocks weren't being accessed correctly from the parent structure

## Fix Implementation
The following changes were made to resolve the issue:

1. **Exact Block Matching**
   ```javascript
   const mySubjournalsBlock = pageData[":block/children"]?.find(block => 
     block[":block/string"]?.trim() === "My Subjournals:"
   );
   ```

2. **Efficient Data Access**
   - Now using the page structure data directly from the initial pull
   - Removed redundant queries for child blocks
   - Simplified the data access pattern

3. **Proper Block Hierarchy**
   - Correctly accessing children through the block structure
   - Using the proper data paths for block relationships

## Testing
The fix was verified by:
1. Confirming the extension now correctly identifies the "My Subjournals:" block
2. Verifying that subjournals are properly detected and displayed
3. Testing with various subjournal configurations
4. Ensuring color settings are properly read

## Impact
This fix improves:
- Reliability of subjournal detection
- Performance by reducing database queries
- Code maintainability through simplified logic
